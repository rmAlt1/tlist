### List FAQ

How long will my record take to get accepted?

- On a normal day it will take 0-48 hours for the record to be accepted,
  sometimes up to 72 hours, which may be slightly common, and if it ever is
  taking more than 72 hours, it will be announced that there is a backup of
  records or some site issues

What do New record, update record, and fix record mean?

- New record is when your submitting a record for a level for the first time,
  update record is when you have a record on a level but you got a new best and
  it needs to be updated, fix record is when there is an issue with one of your
  records that needs to be fixed

It's been like more than a week and my record still hasn't been added, what do i
do?

- You can ask us in
  [#list-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/381513933250494475/381968184875417610)
  , it was probably an accidentally deleted record(yes it happens), accidentally
  deleting the form, your name was mispelled or you were rejected for cheating

When will \_\_\_ be added to the list?

- It may take a while, but it will eventually be added, so be patient

Can I submit Multiple levels on 1 video?

- Yes
